In the previous exercise, we developed a procedural method for computing the value of the nth Fibonacci numbers. This method was really fast, computing the 20899 digit 100,001st Fibonacci sequence almost instantly.

In this exercise, you are going to compute a method that returns the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number.

(examples below)



=end

def fibonacci_last(n)
  fibonacci(n) % 10
end

def fibonacci(n)
  first, second = [1, 1]
  (n - 2).times do
    first, second = [second, first + second]
  end
  return second
end

p fibonacci_last(15)        # -> 0  (the 15th Fibonacci number is 610)
p fibonacci_last(20)        # -> 5 (the 20th Fibonacci number is 6765)
p fibonacci_last(100)       # -> 5 (the 100th Fibonacci number is 354224848179261915075)
p fibonacci_last(100_001)   # -> 1 (this is a 20899 digit number)
p fibonacci_last(1_000_007) # -> 3 (this is a 208989 digit number)
# fibonacci_last(123456789) # -> 4
