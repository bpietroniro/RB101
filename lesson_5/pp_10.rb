# Given the following data structure and without modifying the original
# array, use the map method to return a new array identical in structure
# to the original but where the value of each integer is incremented by 1.
#
# - don't modify the original array
# - new array should have same structure as original
# - wherever an integer appears in the original, its 
#   counterpart in the new array should be 1 greater
#
# input: array of hashes
# output: array of hashes
#
# ALGORITHM
# - iterate through the arraay
#   - iterate through each hash
# 

[{a: 1}, {b: 2, c: 3}, {d: 4, e: 5, f: 6}]
